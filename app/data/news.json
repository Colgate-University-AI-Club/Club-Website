    "summary": "By 2026, autonomous AI agents will manage tasks by controlling tools, not themselves, enabling efficient, microservice-like collaboration across teams for enhanced productivity and security.",
    "content": "It can answer questions like \"What's the AI agent team's top priority?\" It delegates, for instance, a Jira agent to pull tickets or statistics or a call analytics agent to examine customer pain points, or a translation agent to process foreign-language feedback. This structure of an AI agent is very similar to the micro-service architecture in traditional software design â€” most principles from micro services can be applied to the agentic architecture. Another way to guarantee success in creating your AI agent fleet: Forget controlling the agents themselves; control their tools instead. So actual agentic AI security isn't about the LLMs, it's about the tools. By early 2026, AI agents will write their own tools.",

In any case, the topic has immense value as a means of furthering our understanding of the human mind and, likewise, spurs our efforts to push AI computational intelligence toward artificial general intelligence and ultimately arrive at artificial super intelligence or ASI. That would be especially the case if you adopt the premise that the human brain is ingrained in computational intelligence.",
